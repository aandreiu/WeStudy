		"answer": "On WeStudy, you can keep track of tasks for the day and the upcoming week, join study groups for classes you're currently taking, and keep yourself and your friends accountable. WeStudy also helps users become more productive and use their time more efficiently by encouraging users to take productive breaks throughout the day. We all get burnt out working all day, it's important to remember to take a break! WeStudy also increases motivation through incentivization of awards. Users can gain their own personal awards, as well as working together in their study groups to achieve group awards!"
